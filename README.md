# Cisco Live DEVNET-2043
## Learn how to put out your IOT sensor fire with the Cisco Spaces Firehose Streaming API

IOT sensors are becoming cheaper, accessible and finally solving real world problems. For this DevNet lab you will
have hands on experience on how to configure DNA Spaces to use your Wi-Fi infrastructure to capture sensor data and
deliver it on the extremely scalable Firehose streaming API for your own on premise applications. This will enable you
to solve use cases like:

Desk occupancy with the Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor
* Nurse duress using the smart badge with call buttons
* CO2 sensor to measure ventilation
* Temperature & humidity for smart buildings
* Heavy duty tag for asset location and safety

A small collection of example Python scripts to help easily extract data from [Cisco Spaces - Partner](https://partners.dnaspaces.io/).

## Getting Started
* Have a look at the Cisco Spaces Partner Firehose API documentation over at [Partners Documentation](https://partners.dnaspaces.io/docs/v1/basic/index.html#!c-dnas-partners-overview.html).
* Clone this repository into a directory to get the scripts:
```
git clone https://github.com/leigh-jewell/devnet2043.git
```
